                Social media has become ever-present in our personal and professional lives. Kame Enterprises (Fictional Company) utilizes social media to advertise our brand, communicate with clients, and receive feedback on our products and services. Unfortunately,
                the threats presented by social media are increasing rapidly. Phishing scams, attacks on the company's reputation, and data breaches are just a few of the risks the organization faces in using social media for our marketing strategy. To protect 
                the organization's reputation, customers, and employees from these threats, we are implementing this social media security plan, which will hold the organization accountable to best practices as they relate to social media. This social media 
                security plan will highlight common threats and outline the steps the company will take to mitigate these risk factors. All security measures will require the use of monitoring tools, implementation of incident response plans, and social media
                training, all of which are covered in further sections of this page.

                </div>
                <strong><em>Phishing and scams</em></strong>
                <br>
                Phishing scams are scams where individuals impersonate certain people or companies in order to trick users into sharing sensitive information. This is dangerous for the company as phishers could gain access to company accounts and make inappropriate
                posts or even access financial information or client data. Only a select few specially trained personnel are authorized to access the company's social media accounts. These individuals are responsible for the social media content and messaging 
                attributed to the company accounts. They will be trained to identify phishing scams and report them to the social media platform's administrators. As additional security, all company social media accounts will utilize two-factor authentication
                and will be required to update passwords every fiscal quarter. Additionally, no employee is authorized to share private company information such as passwords, client information, or banking details on any platform for any reason. Sharing any private
                company information is a violation of the terms of employment and will result in termination.
                <br>
                <strong><em>Personal Devices and Personal Social Media</em></strong>
                <br>
                In today's tech driven society most of, if not all employees will have their own personal devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and personal computers. Many employees will also have their own personal social media accounts. These personal devices
                hold sensitive information and can be used to harm the company if accessed by bad actors. If a personal device becomes compromised, it could be used to acccess sensitive company information or to access personal social media accounts and make 
                inappropriate posts. Employees are representatives of the organization and as such, inappropriate social media activity can reflect poorly on the company. Employees should ensure that all of their devices are locked with passcode, fingerprint, or 
                face recognition protection to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. 
                <br>
                <strong><em>Company Systems</em></strong>
                <br>
                Company systems will be passcode protected with passcodes being updated every fiscal quarter. Each employee will have their own login credentials to access the systems. Employees must never share the passcode with anyone outside of the company. 
                Additionally, no system should be left open and unattended. Employees should sign out of the system before walking away for any period of time. Any systems found logged in and unattended will result in a written warning for the employee logged in to 
                the system. Further violations after receiving a written warning may result in eventual termination. Under special circumstances, employees may take company systems home with them. In these instances, the employee will be required to fill out a 
                device sign out form with the IT department. When returning to work with the system, it must be submitted to IT for an inspection using monitoring software discussed in the next section.
                <br>
                <strong><em>Imposter Accounts</em></strong>
                <br>
                It is extremely easy for individuals to create fake accounts impersonating the company. Individuals may do this to tarnish the reputation of the organization. Using monitoring technology discussed in the next section, IT can detect any public posts 
                related to the company, fake or not. These accounts should be reported to the social media platform's administrators as soon as possible. If an employee notices any suspicious accounts posting as the organization, they should report the activity to
                IT as soon as possible. Swift removal of imposter accounts from all social media platforms is critical in protecting the organization's reputation.
                <br>
                <strong><em>Third Party Apps and Websites</em></strong>
                <br>
                Downloading third-party applications and visiting inappropriate, non-work related web pages on company systems is not permitted. These websites and applications can infect company systems with spyware or malware which can compromise the organization's
                systems or even reveal login credentials allowing intruders to access the company's social media accounts. Monitoring software covered in the next section will alert the IT department if an employee attempts to download a third-party application or 
                visit any inappropriate websites. Employees caught intentionally installing third party applications or visiting inappropriate websites can be subject to any form of discipline ranging from a written warning to termination depending on the severity 
                of the incident.

                        Google Alerts is a free web application that allows users to enter certain keywords and receive notifications every time they are used across the web. This is a useful tool in tracking users and topics of interest to the organization. 
                        The company can utilize Alerts to track brand mentions on social media, follow media coverage, and track employee social media activity. The application can be extremely useful for being notified about attacks on brand reputation
                        immediately and before they can gain significant traction. <br>

                    Google Trends is a free web application that allows users to search keywords and analyze search traffic over set periods of time dating back to Google's inception. Trends offers a variety of search filters to narrow analysis such as worldwide, 
                    by region, time period range, and language. The company can utilize Trends to analyze brand interest or monitor public sentiment. Company names can be combined with various keywords such as "controversy" or "fraud", to determine urgency
                    and relevance of social media attacks or bad media coverage. Google Trends can also help identify emerging threats before they become widespread. For example, a sudden spike in searches for terms like "phishing scam" might indicate a new wave 
                    of phishing cyberattacks. By analyzing search trends, a company can detect patterns that suggest a rising threat and act quickly, allowing IT teams to update their security measures, push out patches, and train employees to avoid potential 
                    threats.

                    All employees must consent to and be aware of monitoring while using company systems when they are hired by the organization. This helps in ensuring transparency and building trust.
                    <br> 
                    The organization has a legal right to monitor employees during work hours at the workplace. By monitoring employees at work, the company can help ensure productivity and mitigate security risks. Company systems are considered company property 
                    and all activity on company systems can be monitored. Employees that bring home company systems will not be subjected to any live monitoring. However, upon return to the company headquarters the system can be investigated for any misuse by 
                    using digital forensics software such as keyloggers. All employees should use their personal devices for any and all personal communications to maintain their privacy. The company cannot legally monitor personal devices and communications.
                    If the company suspects that an employee is using their personal device for illegal activities, they will need to bring any evidence gathered to the proper authorities who can obtain a search warrant if necessary. 
                    Employees should always be made aware that they are being monitored and how they are being monitored. When adopting new monitoring technology, the organization must clearly communicate with employees how the technology will be used and what 
                    data will be gathered.

                    All activity on company social media accounts is subject to monitoring and review by the company. Employees may have personal social media accounts where they can post their thoughts and opinions publicly. However, they should refrain from 
                    making posts that reflect poorly on the organization or overshare sensitive company and client information. Company management may monitor any public social media activity of employees as it is publicly available for anyone to see legally. Employees 
                    also have the right to create private social media accounts in which their posts are only visible to a select audience. In these instances, the company cannot not attempt to view the private posts without the employee's permission.

                    statements to combat the disparaging posts. It may be necessary for the Marketing team to collaborate with a PR firm to craft the best response possible. Law Enforcement agencies are usually not needed for attacks on reputation. Severe incidents
                    of attacks on reputation can be ongoing battles that require multiple statements and action plans to repair public image. IT must track the brand's reputation via monitoring tools to ensure reputation improvement. Clear communication between
                    IT, Marketing, and Customer Service is critical during this time. Feedback from monitoring software should influence public statements and actions.

                    In cases of a system or account breach or virus attack, the IT department will need to utilize security software to identify the source of the issue and respond appropriately. Breaches and malware attacks put sensitive customer and company 
                    data at risk, so a network shutdown should be implemented immediately until the issue can be resolved. Account passwords must be updated immediately after access is regained.
                    <br>
                    In cases of a breach, IT will need to identify compromised data, recover any missing data, reset all passwords, and deal with any malware left behind by the 
                    attacker. Law Enforcement should be notified of breaches or malware attacks, and IT may need to comply with computer forensics agents to identify culprits and press charges if necessary. Everything that occurs during the incident and 
                    response needs to be documented. Analyzing the information can help in recognizing areas for improvement in the organization's security infrastructure. The integrity of the system security software should be tested regularly, at least twice 
                    a month, to ensure that customer and company data remains as secure as possible.

                    The IT department heads, Human Resources, Legal, Accounting, and Management should be involved at every level of developing social media security plans. IT is integral at all levels of planning, as they are responsible for deploying monitoring 
                    tools, implementing security software, and maintaining anti-virus protections. Being responsible for the organization's technology means that IT will be heavily involved in all issues of cybersecurity. Human Resources enforces company policies 
                    and conducts training programs and thus should be included in the development process. All security plans and policies will need to be reviewed and approved by the Legal department to confirm that they are compliant with federal and state laws 
                    before they can be rolled out. Accounting will need to be consulted at every level to devise the budgets to fund the necessary software and labor costs of plan implementation. Management must collaborate with all departments 
                    in developing plans and policies to ensure that they reflect the values and goals of the organization.

                    Certain incidents will call for specialized incident response plans. As such, certain departments will need to be involved in developing response plans for particular incidents. The organization should strive to include a representative of law
                    enforcement in development for security plans relating to criminal incidents, such as data breaches or phishing scams. Law enforcement can assist in developing these plans by providing insight into the procedures the company
                    will need to comply with during a criminal investigation. Such insights are imperative in developing optimized security plans that effectively support investigative efforts. Customer Service and Marketing will need to be involved in 
                    developing plans for attacks on the company's reputation over social media. IT will detect threats and incidents, but it will fall on Customer Service and Marketing to communicate with the public in response to any incident. Customer Service
                    should assist in developing clear guidelines on what can and cannot be discussed with clients, ensuring consistent and professional responses during incidents. Law enforcement representatives will be asked to participate in developing response
                    plans involving criminal activity. In this way, law enforcement can provide expertise on how best to navigate criminal cases and collaborate in devising clear processes for criminal investigations, optimizing the chances of a conviction.

                    Developing strong Social Media and Acceptable Use policies helps mitigate social media threats from within the company. Employees are representatives of the organization, even outside of work hours. Posting offensive, threatening, or illegal 
                    material can negatively impact company reputation even on personal accounts.

                    Sharing client or private company data can lead to security breaches or endanger clients. Policies should set clear expectations for how employees should use both personal and professional social media accounts.

                    <br>
                    Technology and social media are ever-evolving aspects of life and business. As such, organizations must continually adapt to the constantly shifting technology landscape. As new technology is rolled out, IT should collaborate with Management 
                    and consider potential benefits and drawbacks for each department in incorporating it. It is crucial that policies are revisited and updated frequently to reflect any new technological developments. Any updates to policies and plans must 
                    coincide with the development of new training programs reflecting the changes.
                    <br>
                    Conducting regular audits is essential for ensuring compliance with company policies and identifying any potential gaps in security or operational procedures. Audits help maintain the integrity of the organization’s social media and 
                    acceptable use policies by verifying that all practices adhere to established guidelines. Additionally, audits can uncover vulnerabilities that need to be addressed, thereby strengthening overall security. Feedback mechanisms such as surveys
                    are equally vital as they encourage employees to share their insights and experiences with the policies in place. By cultivating an environment where employees are encouraged to provide feedback, the company can continuously improve 
                    the policies to better meet the needs of both the organization and its staff.

                    This requires looking for potential negative outcomes that may occur as a result of social media use, such as reputational damage from negative comments or privacy breaches due to sharing client data. As new social media platforms and technologies
                    are incorporated into the organization's strategy, identifying risks and developing response plans should be required before implementing the technology into the company's strategy. Risks should also be prioritized based on their likelihood 
                    of occuring and potential severity.
                    <br>  
                    <br> 
                    Once the risks are identified and prioritized, the next step is to develop and implement mitigation strategies. Each high-priority risk should have a detailed action plan that outlines preventive measures, response outlines, and the departments
                    responisble to act in the case of an incident. Regular monitoring and review processes are essential to ensure the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. This includes conducting regular audits to track progress and make
                    necessary adjustments. Additionally, establishing clear communication channels and conducting regular training programs can help prepare the organization for potential threats, ensuring a coordinated response. Different departments
                    will be called on in response plans depending on the type of incident. Ensuring each department is trained and familiar with their responsibilities should an incident occur is critical in mitigating damage. Through continuous 
                    evaluation and improvement, the organization can maintain a proactive stance against risks.

                    Every employee of the company is required to undergo social media training, including high-level management and executives. It is most important that the individuals who represent the company from the top are familiar with social media and how to 
                    appropriately use it so as to not negatively affect the business. As policies change with ever-evolving technology, all employees should undergo training to account for the changes. As with any on-the-job training, training programs 
                    will be mandatory for all employees. Depending on the level of the employee, training can be delivered differently. Lower-level employees can work through virtual training modules, while upper management and executives may attend social media 
                    training seminars in person. Social media training should cover how to use social media and how to best represent the company when online. It should also cover the various threats that social media presents to businesses and best practices to 
                    minimize risks.
                    <br>
                    Incident Response Plans and Disaster Recovery Plans will vary based on incident. It is crucial that all departments relevant to certain high priority risks be trained to respond appropriately. The organization should host routine Incident
                    Response drills for the appropriate departments. Bringing in outside cybersecurity firms to conducts drills and testing can be an effective way to receive an unbiased perspective on department and overall organization preparedness. 
                    Continuous improvement through regular updates, scenario-based training, and clear communication protocols will ensure the organization is fully conditioned to address any social media threats effectively.
