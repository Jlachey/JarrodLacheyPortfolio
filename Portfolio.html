                <b>Sample Social Media Security Plan</b>
                <br>
                <p><em>(self-hosted) Applications</em><br>
                For in-house applications, we need to ensure security protocols are built into the development and deployment process. The latest security techniques and technology are to be integrated into the source code, 
                standard we can possibly have. We must regularly test for commonly exploited vulnerabilities. Our code must implement the best security, privacy, and efficiency practices. IT will study the most widely used applications to adopt their 
                top-of-the-line security processes for our application. It is imperative that potential attackers know as little of our design as possible. Knowledge of our code can lead to the exploitation of any weaknesses that unfortunately may have been 
                overlooked. Because of this, discussing the code with anyone outside of the company is not allowed and may be punishable by termination. <br>
                <strong>Regulatory and Legal Departments</strong><br>
                There are many legal concerns when it comes to our company’s use of social media. Posts that are deemed to contain discriminatory or defamatory content will not be tolerated and will result in termination. Content posted anywhere online that can negatively affect employees or the company could fall into these categories. Such posts could have legal ramifications for the company, so it is imperative that we enforce a zero-tolerance policy. All employees and executives are bound by confidentiality agreements, which strictly prohibit discussing business matters in public forums, including social media. This measure prevents competitors or attackers from learning sensitive information about our company. The confidentiality agreement also protects our customers and clients from having their sensitive data shared online. Failure to comply with the confidentiality agreement can result in termination and potential legal action. 
                    
                    In-House Social Media
                    In addition, our executive team must lead by example, maintaining the highest standards in how we access and interact with these applications. Our policy and training will dictate what is and isn’t appropriate to post on our application as well as how we should interact with our customers and employees. Our reputation is one of our greatest assets and we cannot afford to damage it. As executives, you should refrain from posting anything personal on the application. All executive and employee posts will be submitted to me for approval before being posted publicly. This feature will be coded into our program with all employees having specialized accounts that automatically submit content for approval. Please use externally hosted social media for your personal accounts. Our policy ensures all interactions on our platforms adhere to our standards of professionalism and integrity.
                    Externally Housed Applications
                    Externally housed applications are an essential part of our business. However, the threat of system or account infiltration is just as prevalent, if not more so, than on our company application. We do not have control over the security processes of other applications. So it is crucial that we exercise great care in ensuring that we protect ourselves and the company when using them. Employees and executives will be required to change their passwords regularly and enable multi-factor authentication if it is available for the application. Employees will need to inform IT of any accounts they own so that we may track the time between password resets. All corporate accounts will use passwords set by IT and the relevant personnel will be notified of password changes. 
                    Externally Hosted Social Media
                    Unlike our own application, obviously, employees and executives can create personal social media accounts on external platforms. However, our policies dictate that employees and executives may not post disparaging posts aimed at the company. Additionally, they are not permitted to post any confidential company or customer information on their social media accounts. Doing so violates the confidentiality agreement and will result in termination. In the event of a social media campaign launched against the company, employees are not permitted to respond. Marketing will control the company accounts and will collaborate with a PR firm to construct an appropriate response. Employee and executive responses either defending the company or supporting the campaign can cause further damage to our reputation and worsen the situation. IT will be responsible for using monitoring software to track content mentioning the company and will notify the relevant departments in the event of an attack. 
                    Policy Management
                    As technology continues to evolve and new social media platforms are made, it is imperative that our company keeps its finger on the pulse. We want to be among the earliest to adopt new technologies and trends within the cyber and social media space. Our IT and Marketing departments will select expert members to form a collaborative research team. This team is responsible for analyzing new and emerging social media platforms and technologies, identifying what can benefit our business, and updating our social media policy accordingly. Policy updates will need to be a collaborative effort between IT and HR. HR will also work with IT to develop new training materials to complement major policy changes. It will be the responsibility of IT to develop any specialized incident response plans for new technologies. This plan will need to be effectively communicated in any policy updates so that all relevant departments are aware of what is expected in case of an incident. Each emerging trend can change the landscape of how we operate our business and how we protect against threats through our policies and practices. 
                    Employees
                    •	Acceptable Use Policies
                    Employees are not to disparage the company through public social media content. Any concerns should be communicated to HR for possible solutions rather than online which can damage the company’s reputation. Employees should not post on controversies involving the company on their personal accounts. All defense of the company will be handled by the company account controlled by Marketing. Depending on the severity of any infractions, the offending employee may be subject to termination. Employees are strictly prohibited from revealing any sensitive business information, including but not limited to customer or client data, fellow employees' personal information, and social media account security information (passwords, etc.). Failure to adhere to this will result in immediate termination and potential legal consequences.
                    •	Education and Training
                    All employees are required to complete the online social media course module as part of their regular training. Courses will be uploaded to the company’s training website and can only be accessed through the employees' company account. As policies are regularly updated, training courses will be added to the module. When new courses are added, employees will have a set time period for which they can complete the course. Failure to complete the training within the allotted time will result in a meeting with the head of HR to discuss the issue. Refusal to participate in any training course will result in termination from the company. Employees with disabilities will be accommodated appropriately to assist in completion of assigned training courses.
                    
                    Regulatory Responsibilities
                     The company will need data protection, consumer protection, and intellectual property regulations. The company’s regulatory responsibilities vary based on the services it offers and geographical location. Companies in the healthcare industry would be required to follow HIPAA guidelines while a consumer electronics company would deal more with product safety and IP protection. Healthcare companies likely have more regulations due to the importance of their service and the sensitivity of information. Everyone requires healthcare and the quality of service can be a matter of life and death. That is why strict regulatory guidelines must be in place to ensure a high baseline of quality to best protect patients.

                        Google Alerts is a free web application that allows users to enter certain keywords and receive notifications every time they are used across the web. This is a useful tool in tracking users and topics of interest to any company. 
                        The company can utilize Alerts to track brand mentions on social media, follow media coverage, and track employee social media activity. The application can be extremely useful for being notified about attacks on brand reputation
                        immediately and before they can gain significant traction. <br>

                    Google Trends is a free web application that allows users to search keywords and analyze search traffic over set periods of time dating back to Google's inception. Trends offers a variety of search filters to narrow analysis such as worldwide, 
                    by region, time period range, and language. The company can utilize Trends to analyze brand interest or monitor public sentiment. Company names can be combined with various keywords such as "controversy" or "fraud", to determine urgency
                    and relevance of social media attacks or bad media coverage. Google Trends can also help identify emerging threats before they become widespread. For example, a sudden spike in searches for terms like "phishing scam" might indicate a new wave 
                    of cyberattacks. By analyzing search trends, a company can detect patterns that suggest a rising threat and act quickly, allowing IT teams to update their security measures, push out patches, and train employees to avoid potential threats.

                    Companies have a legal right to monitor employees during work hours at the workplace. By monitoring employees at work, companies can help ensure productivity and mitigate security risks. Company systems are considered company property. Thus
                    all activity on company systems can be monitored. Employees that bring home company systems should not be subjected to any live monitoring. However, upon return to the company headquarters the system can be investigated for any misuse by using
                    digital forensics software such as keyloggers. All employees should use their personal devices for any and all personal communications to maintain their privacy. The company cannot legally monitor personal devices and communications.
                    If the company suspects that an employee is using their personal device for illegal activities, they will need to bring any evidence gathered to the proper authorities who can obtain a search warrant if necessary. 
                    Employees should always be made aware that they are being monitored and how they are being monitored.

                    All activity on company social media accounts is subject to monitoring and review by the company. Employees may have personal social media accounts where they can post their thoughts and opinions publicly. However, they should refrain from 
                    making posts that reflect poorly on the company or pose a security risk. Company management may monitor any public social media activity of employees as it is publicly available for anyone to see legally. Employees also have the right to create 
                    private social media accounts in which their posts are only visible to a select audience. In these instances, companies should not attempt to view the posts without the account holders permission.

                    system or account breach or virus attack, the IT department will need to utilize security software to identify the source of the issue and respond appropriately. Breaches and malware attacks put sensitive customer and company data at risk, so 
                    a network shutdown should be implemented immediately until the issue can be resolved.
                    <br>
                    In cases of a breach, IT will need to identify compromised data, recover any missing data, reset all passwords, and deal with any malware left behind by the 
                    attacker. Law Enforcement should be notified of breaches or malware attacks, and IT may need to comply with computer forensics agents to identify the attacker and press charges, if necessary. Everything that occurs during the incident and 
                    response needs to be documented. Analyzing the information can help in recognizing areas for improvement in the organizations security infrastructure. The integrity of the system security software should be tested regularly, at least twice 
                    a month, to ensure that customer and company data remain as secure as possible.

                    The IT department heads, Human Resources, Legal, Accounting, and Management should be involved at every level of developing social media security plans. IT is integral at all levels of the plan, as they are responsible for deploying monitoring 
                    tools, implementing security software, and maintaining anti-virus protections. Being responsible for the organization's technology means that IT will be heavily involved in all issues of cybersecurity. Human Resources enforces company policies 
                    and conducts training programs and thus should be included in the development process. All security plans and policies will need to be reviewed and approved by legal teams to confirm that they are compliant with federal and state laws before 
                    they can be rolled out. Accounting will need to be consulted at every level to devise the budgets necessary to fund the necessary software and labor costs of plan implementation. Management must collaborate with all of these departments in 
                    developing all plans and policies to ensure that they reflect the values and goals of the organization.

                    Certain incidents will call for specialized incident response plans. As such, certain departments will need to be involved in developing response plans for particular incidents. Customer Service and Marketing will need to be involved in 
                    developing plans for attacks on the company's reputation over social media. IT will detect threats and incidents, but it will fall on Customer Service and Marketing to communicate with the public in response to any incident. Customer Service
                    should assist in developing clear guidelines on what can and cannot be discussed with clients, ensuring consistent and professional responses during incidents.

                    Developing strong Social Media and Acceptable Use policies helps mitigate social media threats from within the company. Employees are representatives of the organization, even outside of work hours. Posting offensive, threatening, or illegal 
                    material can negatively impact company reputation even on personal accounts.

                    Sharing client or private company data can lead to security breaches or endanger clients. Policies should set clear expectations for how employees should use both personal and professional social media accounts.

                    Technology and social media are ever-evolving aspects of life and business. As such, organizations must continually adapt to the constantly shifting technology landscape. As new technology is rolled out, IT should collaborate with Management 
                    and consider potential benefits and drawbacks for each department in incorporating it. It is crucial that policies are revisited and updated frequently to reflect any new technological developments. Any updates to policies and plans must 
                    coincide with the development of new training programs reflecting the changes.
                    <br>
                    Conducting regular audits is essential for ensuring compliance with company policies and identifying any potential gaps in security or operational procedures. Audits help maintain the integrity of the organization’s social media and 
                    acceptable use policies by verifying that all practices adhere to established guidelines. Additionally, audits can uncover vulnerabilities that need to be addressed, thereby strengthening overall security. Feedback mechanisms 
                    are equally vital as they encourage employees to share their insights and experiences with the policies in place. By cultivating an environment where employees are encouraged to provide feedback, companies can continuously improve 
                    their policies to better meet the needs of both the organization and its staff.

                    This requires looking for potential negative outcomes that may occur as a result of social media like reputational damage from negative comments or privacy breaches due to sharing client data. As new social media platforms and technologies
                    are incorporated into the organization's strategy, identifying risks and developing response plans should be required before roll out. Risks should also be prioritized based on their likelihood of occuring and potential severity.

                    <br> 
                    Once the risks are identified and prioritized, the next step is to develop and implement mitigation strategies. Each high-priority risk should have a detailed action plan that outlines preventive measures, response outlines, and the departments
                    responisble to act in the case of an incident. Regular monitoring and review processes are essential to ensure the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. This includes conducting regular audits to track progress and make
                    necessary adjustments. Additionally, establishing clear communication channels and conducting regular training programs can help prepare the organization for potential threats, ensuring a coordinated response. Different departments
                    will be called on in response plans depending on the type of incident. Ensuring each department is trained and familiar with their responsibilities should an incident occur is critical in mitigating damage. Through continuous 
                    evaluation and improvement, the organization can maintain a proactive stance against risks.

                    Every employee of the company should undergo social media training, including high-level management and executives. It is most important that the individuals who represent the company from the top are familiar with social media and how to 
                    appropriately use it so as to not negatively affect the business. As policies change with ever-evolving technology, all employees should undergo training to account for the changes. As with any on-the-job training, training programs 
                    will be mandatory for all employees. Depending on the level of the employee, training can be delivered differently. Lower-level employees can work through virtual training modules, while upper management and executives may attend social media 
                    training seminars in person. Social media training should cover how to use social media and how to best represent the company when online. It should also cover the various threats that social media presents to businesses and best practices to 
                    minimize risks.
                    <br>
                    Incident Response Plans and Disaster Recovery Plans will vary based on incident. It is crucial that all departments relevant to certain high priority risks be trained to respond appropriately. The organization should host routine Incident
                    Response drills for the appropriate departments. Bringing in outside cybersecurity firms to conducts drills and testing can be an effective way to receive an unbiased perspective on department and overall organization preparedness. 
                    Continuous improvement through regular updates, scenario-based training, and clear communication protocols will ensure the organization is fully conditioned to address any social media threats effectively.
